You can load a sample board at the start of a game.
The first 8 rows of a file represent the state of the board.
The spacing is not important; I spaced them to make them readable.
For Checkers, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent an empty square,
a regular piece for player 1, a regular piece for player 2,
a king for player 1, and a king for player 2, respectively.
For Othello, 0, 1, and 2 represent an emtpy square,
a piece for player 1, and a piece for player 2, respectively.
For both games, the numbers in the final two rows represent
whose turn it is (player 1 or player 2), and the time limit
(for any turn played by the computer).
